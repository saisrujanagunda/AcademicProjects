# Creditcard Fraud Detection

In this project, I delved into credit card fraud detection using R. Now, you might think that's old news, right? Well, this project had a twist: the dataset I worked with was imbalanced.

What does that mean? Essentially, it means that the number of fraudulent transactions was tiny compared to the legitimate ones, making it like searching for a needle in a haystack. But hey, who doesn't love a challenge?

While working on this project, I learned some pretty good techniques (under-sampling) for handling imbalanced data. But the real magic happened when I put those techniques to the test. I managed to achieve an impressive 99% efficiency in detecting fraud. 

So, while the concept of fraud detection might not be new, the journey certainly was. All in all, this project was a rewarding and enlightening experience. It showed me that with the right tools and techniques.
